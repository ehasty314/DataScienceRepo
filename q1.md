This is the raw data which is the 1st step:

Height Weight Age Grip strength Frailty
65.8    112    30       30         N
71.5    136    19       31         N
69.4    153    45       29         N
68.2    142    22       28         Y
67.8    144    29       24         Y
68.7    123    50       26         N
69.8    141    51       22         Y
70.1    136    23       20         Y
67.9    112    17       19         N
66.8    120    39       31         N

Some potential options for the second step are to sort the rows by category, i.e. put all the non frail together and put the frail together.
Visual inspection shows that there are no null values, but had there been more categories, it would have been a good idea to check.

The third and final step is to begin data analysis. Correlation analyses can reveal relationships between grip strength and factors like age or weight. 
Visual tools such as scatter plots and histograms can provide insights into variable distributions, while group analyses based on frailty status may indicate trends or 
significant differences in other attributes. Statistical methods like t-tests or regression analyses can further validate findings and help predict outcomes, 
such as frailty status based on other attributes. Calculating the means and medians of the numerical columns, and potentially the frequency of frailty may yield useful results.

Phase 1 Folder will include the raw data
Phase 2 Folder will include the preprocessed data and the script to take it from the raw data to processed.
Phase 3 Folder will include the programs for analysis and any conclusions.
